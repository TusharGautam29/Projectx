DDoS Attack Detection Using Entropy-Based Analysis
Introduction
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a serious threat to online services, where servers are overwhelmed with excessive traffic, often rendering them inaccessible to legitimate users. This project presents a Python-based method to detect DDoS attacks using entropy-based analysis of network traffic.

Methodology
The detection method leverages entropy, a concept from information theory that quantifies the randomness in a dataset. In this context, entropy is used to measure the distribution of IP addresses from which data packets originate.

Steps Involved
Simulating Network Traffic:

Normal Traffic: Generated from a wide range of IP addresses, resulting in higher entropy.
Attack Traffic: Simulated by concentrating traffic from a smaller set of IP addresses, resulting in lower entropy.
Entropy Calculation:

Entropy is calculated using the Shannon entropy formula:
python
Copy code
H = -sum(p(i) * math.log2(p(i)) for p(i) in traffic_distribution)
where p(i) is the probability of packets originating from IP address i.
Threshold Setting:

A threshold entropy value is determined by averaging the entropy values from normal and attack traffic. This threshold is used to classify incoming traffic.
Detection and Accuracy Measurement:

The system classifies traffic as normal or a potential DDoS attack based on whether its entropy is above or below the threshold. Accuracy is evaluated by simulating multiple test cases.
Implementation
The implementation is divided into several key functions:

send_packets(num_packets, num_ips, attack=False): Simulates network traffic with either a uniform or concentrated distribution of IP addresses.
compute_entropy(traffic): Calculates the entropy of the given traffic data.
detect_ddos(traffic, threshold_entropy): Classifies the traffic based on its entropy.
find_accuracy(num_tests, num_packets, num_ips, threshold_entropy, verbose=False): Evaluates the detection accuracy by running multiple test scenarios.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
# Parameters
num_packets = 10000
num_ips = 100
num_tests = 100

# Run DDoS detection simulation
run_ddos_detection(num_packets=num_packets, num_ips=num_ips, num_tests=num_tests, verbose=True)
Results
The entropy-based method successfully distinguishes between normal and DDoS attack traffic. Normal traffic typically exhibits higher entropy due to the diverse distribution of IP addresses, while DDoS attack traffic shows lower entropy due to its concentration from a few IP sources.

Conclusion
This entropy-based approach provides an effective method for detecting DDoS attacks by analyzing the diversity of IP addresses in network traffic. Future work may involve integrating this technique with real-time monitoring systems and exploring machine learning methods to enhance detection accuracy further.
