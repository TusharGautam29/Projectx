DDoS Attack Detection Using Entropy-Based Analysis
Introduction
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to online services by overwhelming servers with massive amounts of traffic, often making them inaccessible to legitimate users. Detecting such attacks quickly and accurately is crucial for mitigating their impact. This repository provides a Python implementation of a method to detect DDoS attacks using entropy-based analysis of network traffic.

Methodology
This detection method uses entropy, a measure from information theory, to quantify the randomness in the distribution of IP addresses from which data packets originate. The key idea is that normal traffic has a more uniform distribution of IP addresses, resulting in higher entropy, while DDoS traffic, concentrated from a few IP sources, has lower entropy.

Steps of the Approach
Simulating Network Traffic:

Normal Traffic: Simulated by generating data packets from a wide range of IP addresses, leading to a higher entropy.
Attack Traffic: Simulated by concentrating data packets from a small subset of IP addresses, leading to lower entropy.
Entropy Calculation:

Entropy is calculated using the Shannon entropy formula:
python
Copy code
H = -sum(p(i) * math.log2(p(i)) for p(i) in traffic_distribution)
where p(i) is the probability of packets originating from IP address i.
Threshold Setting:

The threshold entropy is determined by averaging the entropy values from normal and attack traffic simulations. Traffic with entropy below this threshold is classified as a potential DDoS attack.
Detection and Accuracy Measurement:

The method classifies traffic by comparing its entropy to the threshold. Accuracy is evaluated by simulating multiple instances of normal and attack traffic.
Implementation
The implementation consists of several Python functions:

send_packets(num_packets, num_ips, attack=False): Simulates network traffic by generating a list of IP addresses.
compute_entropy(traffic): Computes the entropy of the traffic data.
detect_ddos(traffic, threshold_entropy): Classifies traffic as normal or a DDoS attack.
find_accuracy(num_tests, num_packets, num_ips, threshold_entropy, verbose=False): Calculates the detection accuracy across multiple test cases.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
# Parameters
num_packets = 10000
num_ips = 100
num_tests = 100

# Run DDoS detection simulation
run_ddos_detection(num_packets=num_packets, num_ips=num_ips, num_tests=num_tests, verbose=True)
Results
The entropy-based method effectively distinguishes between normal and DDoS attack traffic. Normal traffic typically shows higher entropy due to the diverse distribution of IP addresses, while DDoS traffic shows lower entropy due to its concentration from a limited number of IP sources. The detection method was found to be accurate in classifying traffic under various test conditions.

Conclusion
This entropy-based approach to DDoS detection provides a reliable and efficient method for identifying abnormal traffic patterns. By analyzing the diversity of IP addresses in network traffic, this method can detect potential DDoS attacks with high accuracy. Future improvements could include integrating this approach with real-time monitoring systems and exploring machine learning techniques to further enhance detection capabilities.
